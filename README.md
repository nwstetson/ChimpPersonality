# ChimpPersonality

This is a project that uses the chimpanzee personality survey from the Emotions Profile Index and Hominoid Personality Questionnaire (which is the Big 5 plus "Dominance") as utilized in "Personality in the chimpanzees of Gombe National Park" by Weiss, et al., 2017

The goal of this project is to examine what predicts people's assessments of chimpanzee personality.
