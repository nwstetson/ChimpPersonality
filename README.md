# Chimp Personality

This is a project that uses the chimpanzee personality survey from the Emotions Profile Index and Hominoid Personality Questionnaire (which is the Big 5 plus "Dominance") as utilized in "Personality in the chimpanzees of Gombe National Park" by Weiss, et al., 2017.

The goal of this project is to examine what predicts people's assessments of chimpanzee personality, as well as whether homophily in personality predicts stronger relationships between chimps.

#### Check back later for updates! I will be working on this throughout the semester.
